Two types of Regular Expressions in Cucumber:

1. Regular Expression --> [0-9]+, (\\d+), \"(.*)\"
2. Cucumber Expression (2017) 

rules:
1. Step definition file will be generating cucumber expression by default
2. But you can use regular expression also in step definition file 
3. You can mix both regular and cucumber expressions in step definition file
4. but you can not mix both expressions in a step definition method,
 either this or that should be in a method only.

{string} {int} {float} --> cucumber expression
